# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **A-Frame**

---
## Learning Log 1
### 3/10/25: 
* Used resources linked in the A-frame tool list, which was an assortment of videos to learn how to use A-frame better which are all listed in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWkWuhMLkR7D_VSEMkj45NIgF8i2dlUce). I was able to create a scene in A-frame that featured a box and a few other shapes which was taught to us in the first video and also how to change the position of the shapes. I then was able to enter the scene and move around which was pretty cool, but I still want to learn more and a question I had was if we could make our own shapes by merging other shapes to create one. Or could we only pick from the shapes available, because if we can't merge them then making my freedom project idea will be quite hard.
