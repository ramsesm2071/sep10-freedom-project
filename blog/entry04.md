# Entry 4: Selecting and Using My Tool (A-frame)
##### 2/28/25

## Context
-----
The tool I have selected was A-frame, and have just recently started tinkering with it due to hesitation choosing which tool I wanted to study and try and learn. But I ended up  choosing A-frame after tinkering with other tools such as [Flexbox-Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Animate-CSS.](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) Causing me to lose out on a lot of time tinkering that need's to be made up with A-frame. But A-frame is quite enjoyable to use and I find myself often getting engrossed when coding using A-frame.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the sixth stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I test and evaluate the prototype, which is me just tinkering in my IDE using a-frame. So far I've been getting the hang of it quite quickly due to having a friend willing to help teach me the basics of A-frame and it's helped me learned a lot in a little bit of time.

## Skills

After working with multiple groups of partners, while most went fine some were quite shaky and had their own set of hardships that came with each group, but one specific group I had trouble with was a group that required constant help which made me have to take a leadership role if we wanted to try and get a solid grade leading me to not have time for my own work if I wanted to help them for the period. To solve this I had to do work at home but in the end we were able to still get some work done and come out with a very good grade, and I was really proud of myself for the project we worked on even though I wasn't able to do everything I wanted, I was still able to enjoy my time doing the project and learned lots while working on it, such as communication skills and overall being very patient with others.

Another skill that I learned was breaking the parts of the project into smaller pieces so that each person got a fair amount of work and the freedom to continue with their own side of the project while also not hitting a writers block due to having multiple partners to help them each time they ran out of ideas, so we would be able to back each other up if we required help on either ideas or coding.
