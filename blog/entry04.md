# Entry 4: Selecting and Using My Tool (A-frame)
##### 2/28/25

## Context
-----
The tool I have selected was A-frame, and have just recently started tinkering with it due to tinkering with other tools such as [Flexbox-Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Animate-CSS.](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) Causing me to lose out on a lot of time tinkering that need's to be made up with A-frame. But A-frame is quite enjoyable to use and I find myself often getting engrossed when coding using A-frame.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the sixth stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I test and evaluate the prototype, which is me just tinkering in my IDE using a-frame. So far I've been getting the hang of it quite quickly due to having a friend willing to help teach me the basics of A-frame and it's helped me get on my feet quite quickly.

## Skills

One skill I developed during this freedom project is organization and time management. I made sure to plan my day and set aside specific times to work on the project, and I often listened to music while doing it. This helped me stay focused and enjoy the process keeping my productivity and motivation up, while also balancing my tasks better. By organizing my work schedule in a way that let me listen to music and get things done, I stayed motivated, even when things got harder. This way, I kept up with my work and made sure it was consistent.

Another skill I improved is researching. I learned how to find and read different articles about music, technology, and the pros and cons of how technology affects the music industry, especially for artists. For example, while technology helps artists gain exposure across the globe, it also creates problems regarding how they get paid fairly. Doing this research has helped me deepen my understanding of music and motivated me to keep working hard on my project.

## Summary

In the end, I’m really excited to work on my project about music and how technology impacts the industry. It all started with my passion for music, which has been a significant part of my life and a great way for me to relieve stress. Through this project, I’ve learned a lot about how technology helps artists create and share their work, as well as the challenges they face, such as fair compensation. I find it fascinating how tools like DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) have transformed the way music is produced and experienced, which has inspired me to explore making music myself and consider a career path that includes music.

## Next Steps
I look forward to continuing my research on how technology impacts music and exploring the various tools that artists use to create. I’m excited to learn more about the innovations in music production, understand the challenges artists face, and discover how I can apply this knowledge to my own creative journey.
