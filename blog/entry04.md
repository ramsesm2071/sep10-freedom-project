# Entry 4: Selecting and Using My Tool (A-frame)
##### 2/28/25

## Context
-----
The tool I have selected was A-frame, and have just recently started tinkering with it due to hesitation choosing which tool I wanted to study and try and learn. But I ended up  choosing A-frame after tinkering with other tools such as [Flexbox-Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Animate-CSS.](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) Causing me to lose out on a lot of time tinkering that need's to be made up with A-frame. But A-frame is quite enjoyable to use and I find myself often getting engrossed when coding using A-frame.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the sixth stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I test and evaluate the prototype, which is me just tinkering in my IDE using a-frame. So far I've been getting the hang of it quite quickly due to having a friend willing to help teach me the basics of A-frame and it's helped me get on my feet quite quickly.

## Skills

After working with multiple groups of partners, while most went fine some were quite shaky and had their own set of hardships that came with each group, but one specific group I had trouble with was where I needed to constantly help 2 teammates which was very stressing but in the end
