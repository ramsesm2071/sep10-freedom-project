# Entry 2 Of My Freedom Project Topic (Music)
#### 11/12/24
## Context
The Freedom project is a year-long project and I have chosen music to be my topic, the last entry I did contained articles of the impact of music on the world and how it affected people in different ways including myself.

Some articles I read include Keep Your Brain Young with Music by Yellowbrick, The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive created by John Hopkins medicine, The Impact Of Technology on the Music World made by MDLBEAST, and Achieving Fair Compensation for Artists: A Comprehensive Guide made by Yellowbrick. After reading this articles I thought it to be intriguing how music could affect oneself and the impact technology had on music as well as I also thought of the difficulties music artists faced.

Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the second stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I need to research the problem I defined in stage one in greater depth. The problem I identified is that while online music provides artists with global exposure, it also poses challenges in ensuring fair compensation and has contributed to the decline of traditional music stores. In this stage, we are tasked with researching a topic we are passionate about and exploring how technology influences it. For example, technology has led to the development of software instruments, electronic production techniques, and Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). These innovations give artists powerful tools to experiment with sounds, collaborate remotely, and produce music independently.

Skills
One skill I developed during this freedom project is organization and time management. I made sure to plan my day and set aside specific times to work on the project, and I often listened to music while doing it. This helped me stay focused and enjoy the process keeping my productivity and motivation up, while also balancing my tasks better. By organizing my work schedule in a way that let me listen to music and get things done, I stayed motivated, even when things got harder. This way, I kept up with my work and made sure it was consistent.

Another skill I improved is researching. I learned how to find and read different articles about music, technology, and the pros and cons of how technology affects the music industry, especially for artists. For example, while technology helps artists gain exposure across the globe, it also creates problems regarding how they get paid fairly. Doing this research has helped me deepen my understanding of music and motivated me to keep working hard on my project.

Summary
In the end, I’m really excited to work on my project about music and how technology impacts the industry. It all started with my passion for music, which has been a significant part of my life and a great way for me to relieve stress. Through this project, I’ve learned a lot about how technology helps artists create and share their work, as well as the challenges they face, such as fair compensation. I find it fascinating how tools like DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) have transformed the way music is produced and experienced, which has inspired me to explore making music myself and consider a career path that includes music.

Next Steps
I look forward to continuing my research on how technology impacts music and exploring the various tools that artists use to create. I’m excited to learn more about the innovations in music production, understand the challenges artists face, and discover how I can apply this knowledge to my own creative journey.
