# Entry 3: Brainstorming for future innovation (Music)
##### 12/18/24

## Context 

While continuing my freedom project I thought up of many different inventions that could either help artists make music, or help people find the right genre of music for them. At first I thought of headphones that played music based on reading your brain waves, finding your emotion and playing a song that matches that emotion, but another device called the mico headphones already was invented which matched my idea. [Here is the article if you are interested on it.](https://phys.org/news/2013-03-brain-wave-sensing-mico-headphones-dictate.html#:~:text=The%20headphones%20are%20designed%20to,into%20its%20mind%2Dreading%20technology.) I continued to think of other future inventions that could benefit everybody, but I couldn't get the emotion based headphones out of my head, so an invention I thought of was instead of playing music based off emotion, why couldn't there be a device that created music based off the sound waves in your brain to get the most precise results for what the consumer is thinking of?
