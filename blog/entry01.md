# Entry 1 Deciding My Freedom Project Topic (Music)
##### 10/7/24

-----
The topic I'm exploring for my year-long freedom project is music, as it’s my greatest passion. I find music engaging for audiences due to its diverse genres and the versatility they offer. Music has been a significant stress reliever for me and I often listen to it while doing homework. Initially, I considered focusing on fishing, which I enjoyed doing with my father, but ultimately chose music because it has helped me through many years. While researching music, I always listened to it, which motivated me and helped me stay focused.

Some articles I read include  [Keep Your Brain Young with Music](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music#:~:text=It%20provides%20a%20total%20brain,%2C%20mental%20alertness%2C%20and%20memory.) by Yellowbrick, [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) created by John Hopkins medicine, [The Impact Of Technology on the Music World](https://mdlbeast.com/xp-feed/music-industry/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-music-world) made by MDLBEAST, and [Achieving Fair Compensation for Artists: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/achieving-fair-compensation-for-artists-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Artists%20face%20challenges%20such%20as,a%20living%20from%20their%20craft.) made by Yellowbrick. After reading this articles I thought it to be intriguing how music could affect oneself and the impact technology had on music as well as I also thought of the difficulties music artists faced.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the second stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I need to research the problem I defined in stage one in greater depth. The problem I identified is that while online music provides artists with global exposure, it also poses challenges in ensuring fair compensation and has contributed to the decline of traditional music stores. In this stage, we are tasked with researching a topic we are passionate about and exploring how technology influences it. For example, technology has led to the development of software instruments, electronic production techniques, and Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). These innovations give artists powerful tools to experiment with sounds, collaborate remotely, and produce music independently.

## Skills

One skill I developed during this freedom project is organization and time management. I made sure to plan my day and set aside specific times to work on the project, and I often listened to music while doing it. This helped me stay focused and enjoy the process keeping my productivity and motivation up, while also balancing my tasks better. By organizing my work schedule in a way that let me listen to music and get things done, I stayed motivated, even when things got harder. This way, I kept up with my work and made sure it was consistent.

Another skill I improved is researching. I learned how to find and read different articles about music, technology, and the pros and cons of how technology affects the music industry, especially for artists. For example, while technology helps artists gain exposure across the globe, it also creates problems regarding how they get paid fairly. Doing this research has helped me deepen my understanding of music and motivated me to keep working hard on my project.

## Summary

In the end, I'm really excited to work on my project about music and how technology impacts the industry. It all started with my passion for music, which has been a significant part of my life and a way for me to relieve stress. Through this project, I’ve learned so much about how technology helps artists create and share their work, but I've also discovered the challenges they face, like fair compensation. I find it really fascinating how tools like Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) have transformed the way music is produced and experienced and makes me want to experience making music, as well as wanting to make me go down a career path including music.
