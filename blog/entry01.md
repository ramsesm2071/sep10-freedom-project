# Entry 1 Deciding My Freedom Project Topic (Music)
##### 10/7/24

-----
The topic i'm doing for my year-long freedom project is music because it's the topic i'm most passionate about as well as I found music to be engaging for audiences because of the amount of different genres music has and how much versatility it provides when it comes to those genres. I've been interested in music for quite a while as it was a big stress reliever and I would always listen to it while doing something like homework.  At first I was going to do something like fishing because it's something I enjoyed doing with my father. But I decided on music as it's helped me get through most of the years. Even while researching about music, I would always listen to music and it really got me in the mood to do my work and I would always be focused. Some articles with different topics that I read about are [Keep Your Brain Young with Music](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music#:~:text=It%20provides%20a%20total%20brain,%2C%20mental%20alertness%2C%20and%20memory.) by Yellowbrick, [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) created by John Hopkins medicine, and [The Impact Of Technology on the Music World](https://mdlbeast.com/xp-feed/music-industry/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-music-world) made by MDLBEAST. After reading this articles I thought it to be intriguing how music could affect oneself and the effect technology had on music.


## Engineering Design Process

I am in the second stage of the engineering design process, where I must research more about the problem. The problem that I defined in stage one was that online music allows for exposure to a global audience, but that poses challenges regarding fair compensation for the artist.
