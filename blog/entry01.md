# Entry 1 Deciding My Freedom Project Topic (Music)
##### 10/7/24

-----
The topic I'm exploring for my year-long freedom project is music, as itâ€™s my greatest passion. I find music engaging for audiences due to its diverse genres and the versatility they offer. Music has been a significant stress reliever for me and I often listen to it while doing homework. Initially, I considered focusing on fishing, which I enjoyed doing with my father, but ultimately chose music because it has helped me through many years. While researching music, I always listened to it, which motivated me and helped me stay focused.

Some articles I read include  [Keep Your Brain Young with Music](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music#:~:text=It%20provides%20a%20total%20brain,%2C%20mental%20alertness%2C%20and%20memory.) by Yellowbrick, [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) created by John Hopkins medicine, [The Impact Of Technology on the Music World](https://mdlbeast.com/xp-feed/music-industry/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-music-world) made by MDLBEAST, and [Achieving Fair Compensation for Artists: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/achieving-fair-compensation-for-artists-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Artists%20face%20challenges%20such%20as,a%20living%20from%20their%20craft.) made by Yellowbrick. After reading this articles I thought it to be intriguing how music could affect oneself and the impact technology had on music as well as I also thought of the difficulties music artists faced.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the second stage of the Engineering Design Process (EDP), where I need to research the problem I defined in stage one in greater depth. The problem I identified is that while online music provides artists with global exposure, it also poses challenges in ensuring fair compensation and has contributed to the decline of traditional music stores. In this stage, we are tasked with researching a topic we are passionate about and exploring how technology influences it. For example, technology has led to the development of software instruments, electronic production techniques, and Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). These innovations give artists powerful tools to experiment with sounds, collaborate remotely, and produce music independently.

## Skills

A skill I learned while doing this freedom project is _organization and time management_ because I dedicated different times of my day to this project and listen to music showing that I am able to structure my workflow where I am still motivated and passionate about working while also maintaining maximum productivity.
