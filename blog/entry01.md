# Entry 1 Deciding My Freedom Project Topic (Music)
##### 10/7/24

-----
The topic I'm exploring for my year-long freedom project is music, as itâ€™s my greatest passion. I find music engaging for audiences due to its diverse genres and the versatility they offer. Music has been a significant stress reliever for me and I often listen to it while doing homework. Initially, I considered focusing on fishing, which I enjoyed doing with my father, but ultimately chose music because it has helped me through many years. While researching music, I always listened to it, which motivated me and helped me stay focused.

Some articles I read include  [Keep Your Brain Young with Music](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music#:~:text=It%20provides%20a%20total%20brain,%2C%20mental%20alertness%2C%20and%20memory.) by Yellowbrick, [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) created by John Hopkins medicine, [The Impact Of Technology on the Music World](https://mdlbeast.com/xp-feed/music-industry/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-music-world) made by MDLBEAST, and [Achieving Fair Compensation for Artists: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/achieving-fair-compensation-for-artists-a-comprehensive-guide#:~:text=Artists%20face%20challenges%20such%20as,a%20living%20from%20their%20craft.) made by Yellowbrick. After reading this articles I thought it to be intriguing how music could affect oneself and the impact technology had on music as well as I also thought of the difficulties music artists faced.




## Engineering Design Process

I am in the second stage of the engineering design process, where I must research more about the problem. The problem that I defined in stage one was that online music allows for exposure to a global audience, but that poses challenges regarding fair compensation for the artist. While in step 2 of the EDP (Engineering Deign ProcessA) we must research more about the topic we are passionate about and how technology is used in that topic. For example technology allowed for the accessibilty of online music which caused a decline in traditional music stores.
