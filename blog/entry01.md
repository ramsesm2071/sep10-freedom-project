# Entry 1 Deciding My Freedom Project Topic
##### 10/7/24

-----
The topic i'm doing for my freedom project is music because it's the topic i'm most passionate about. I've been interested in music for quite a while as it was a big stress reliever and I would always listen to it while doing something like homework. At first I was going to do something like fishing because it's something I enjoyed doing with my father. But I decided on music as it's helped me get through most of the years. Even while researching about music, I would always listen to music and it really got me in the mood to do my work and I would always be focused. Some articles with different topics that I read about are [Keep Your Brain Young with Music](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music#:~:text=It%20provides%20a%20total%20brain,%2C%20mental%20alertness%2C%20and%20memory.) by Yellowbrick and [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) created by John Hopkins medicine.
