# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Imagine a pair of headphones that could make whatever song you think of, and you could share this song to all your friends, or even make a song with those friends!

## Product
* Well imagine no longer, because these pair of headphones are called [Brain Beats](https://ramsesm2071.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/), and they can create a song using your brainwaves that can be shared to all your friends.

## Process
* I first thought of this idea when I thought of a pair of headphones that could play music based on your mood but it had already been made, so I wanted to take it up a notch and create an improved version. Then when I started brainstorming I came up with many ideas and kept going and going, until I thought I had a lot of features already added, I started to work on a wireframe and my tool which was A-frame, then I used my finished and revised wireframe to make my website and I thought it turned out well.


## Conclusion
* Something I learned from this project was to take it serious and not to procrastinate it, but also make time for it because when I finally started doing the project and made time for it I really enjoyed doing it and I'm happy of my end product.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
